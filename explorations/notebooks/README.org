#+TITLE: Notebooks

This directory contain all the notebooks (Ipython, org files, etc), that demonstrate the analysis and the corresponding results. 
They typically use the following naming convention:

=<number>_<analysis tag>_<brief name of the analysis>=

For example, =111_anl_aesthValueIn1dim=.

It's recommended a brief (one-line summary) to be noted in the [[./ealog.org][log file]]
